# Profile Page Updates - Summary

## Overview
Updated the profile page to properly handle different user types (individual users vs employees) based on the API specification, and implemented edit profile functionality with appropriate restrictions.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. **Enhanced Profile Page (`ProfilePage`)**
- **API Integration**: Now uses `getUserProfileExtended()` to fetch complete user profile data
- **Employee Detection**: Properly detects if user is an employee based on `isEmployee` field
- **Conditional UI**: Shows different interface elements based on user type

### 2. **Employee-Specific Features**
- **Organization Information**: Shows organization name, department, employee ID, and position for employees
- **Employee Stats Card**: Displays organization details, employee code, and position in a dedicated card
- **Restricted Menu**: Different menu options for employees vs individual users
- **Activity Sections**: Employee-specific options like "Redemption History" and "Coupons & Benefits"

### 3. **Individual User Features**
- **Full Edit Access**: Individual users can edit their profile information
- **Standard Options**: Access to order history, privacy settings, etc.
- **Gift Cards & Coupons**: Standard rewards management

### 4. **Edit Profile Implementation (`EditProfilePage`)**
- **Smart Detection**: Automatically detects user type and shows appropriate interface
- **Employee Restrictions**: Employees see a read-only view with explanation that profile is managed by organization
- **Individual User Editing**: Full editing capabilities for first name, last name
- **Email Protection**: Email field is read-only for all users (security)
- **Form Validation**: Proper validation for required fields
- **API Integration**: Uses `updateProfile()` method to save changes
- **Success Handling**: Shows success message and returns to profile page with updated data

### 5. **Conditional Menu Items**
- **Account Section**: 
  - Employees: "View Profile" (read-only)
  - Individuals: "View Profile" (editable)
  - Privacy & Security only shown for individuals
- **Activity Section**:
  - Employees: Favorites, Coupons & Benefits, Redemption History
  - Individuals: Order History, Favorites, Gift Cards & Coupons

### 6. **User Experience Improvements**
- **Visual Indicators**: Employee accounts show organization badge and employee-specific styling
- **Clear Messaging**: Employees understand why they can't edit their profile
- **Seamless Navigation**: Profile updates automatically refresh the main profile page
- **Loading States**: Proper loading indicators during API calls
- **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages

## Technical Details

### API Endpoints Used
- `GET /api/users/profile` - Fetch complete user profile (via `getUserProfileExtended()`)
- `PUT /api/users/profile` - Update user profile (via `updateProfile()`)

### User Type Detection
```dart
bool isEmployee = userProfile.isEmployee;
bool hasOrganization = userProfile.organizationId != null;
String? organizationName = userProfile.organizationName;
```

### Conditional UI Pattern
```dart
if (_userProfile!.isEmployee) {
  // Employee-specific UI
} else {
  // Individual user UI
}
```

### Profile Data Structure
- **Individual Users**: Basic profile with points, favorites, order history
- **Employees**: Extended profile with organization details, employee code, department, position, join date

## File Structure
```
lib/presentation/profile/
├── pages/
│   ├── profile_page.dart          # Main profile page with conditional logic
│   └── edit_profile_page.dart     # Edit profile with employee restrictions
├── widgets/
│   ├── profile_header.dart        # User avatar and basic info
│   ├── profile_menu_item.dart     # Reusable menu items
│   ├── profile_stats_card.dart    # Statistics cards
│   └── widgets.dart               # Barrel file
└── profile.dart                   # Main barrel file
```

## Security & Business Logic
- **Employee Profiles**: Read-only, managed by organization
- **Email Immutability**: Email addresses cannot be changed by users
- **Profile Validation**: Required fields enforced (first name, last name)
- **API Error Handling**: Proper error handling with user feedback

## Future Enhancements
- Points ledger integration for detailed point history
- Order history API integration
- Employee-specific analytics
- Organization-wide features
- Profile photo upload functionality

The implementation successfully addresses all requirements: proper API usage, employee-specific UI, individual user editing capabilities, and appropriate restrictions based on user type.
